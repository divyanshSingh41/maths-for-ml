# Limits for Machine Learning
This repository contains my learning notes and Python implementations of Limits, focused specifically on their role in Machine Learning and Optimization.

# Importance of LIMITS in Machine Learning

Limits are fundamental to:

* Understanding derivatives

* Computing gradients numerically

* Analyzing loss functions

* Learning how Gradient Descent works

Without limits, concepts like backpropagation and optimization cannot be understood properly.

📚 **Topics Covered**

1️⃣ Concept of Limits

2️⃣ Fraction Limits

3️⃣ Indeterminate Fraction Examples

---

## **To strengthen intuition, limits are explored using:**

Numerical approximation (values near the point)

Graphs using Matplotlib

Left and right side behavior visualization

This reflects how computers approximate limits in real ML systems.
