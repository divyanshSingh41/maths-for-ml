# Functions and Graphs for Machine Learning (From Scratch)

## 1. Why I Am Learning Functions and Graphs

In Machine Learning, a model is a **function**.
It takes input data and gives output values.

Graphs help us **see** how a function behaves.
This is important for understanding how ML models work.

## 2. What is a Function?
In mathematics, a function is fundamentally a relationship between two sets of data. It describes a specific rule: for every input you put in, you get exactly one output.
example:- y= 2x + 3

## 3. Functions in Machine Learning

In ML:
- `x` = input feature
- `y` = output or prediction
- `f(x)` = model

y = wx + b - This is a **linear regression model**.

## 4. What is a Graph?
A graph shows the relation between input and output.
- x-axis → input value
- y-axis → output value

Graphs help us understand:
- how output changes
- how fast it changes
- the shape of a function

## Linear Function 
A linear function is a function that creates a straight line when graphed. It represents a relationship with a constant rate of change.
Example:
- $$y = mx + b$$, where m = slope, b = intercept
- y1 = 3*x + 2 is a linear function ($m=3, b=2$).

## What is slope?
slope is a number that describes both the steepness and the direction of a line.
Mathematicians usually use the letter 3$m$ to represent slope.4 If you have two points on a graph, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the formula is:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

## Quadratic Function
A quadratic function is a type of non-linear function where the highest power of the variable ($x$) is 2.
While a linear function makes a straight line, a quadratic function creates a smooth, U-shaped curve called a parabola.
The standard form of a quadratic function is: $$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$
